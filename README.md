## Summary

### Questions Regarding the “Silver Tsunami”

1.	How many roles will need to be filled as the “silver tsunami” begins to make an impact. 72,458 roles will need to be filled.
2.	Are their enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees.  We have 1,549 employees available to mentor or 2% of the retirement population.

We refactored the code used to run the original analysis for departments instead of titles.  Based on the results we determined the number of anticipated retirements by department and the mentors available by department.

The results are as follows:

![Mentoring_Dept.png](https://github.com/nkinsler/Pewlett_Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/PNG/Mentoring%20Dept.png)!

![Department_Eligibility.png](https://github.com/nkinsler/Pewlett_Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/PNG/Department%20Eligibility.png)!

The results indicate that the focus of the mentorship should be around the development and production departments.  Both departments have the greatest number of available mentors while also representing the departments that will be most impacted by the “silver tsunami.”
